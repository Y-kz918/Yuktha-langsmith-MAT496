video 1 - The video introduces the @traceable decorator in LangSmith. It automatically builds a “run tree” of function calls, making it easier to track performance, debug apps, and organize runs with metadata.

video 2 - The video explains how to set up observability for LangChain agents. It covers tracing and logging different run types (LLM, retriever, tool), handling streaming outputs, adding metadata for model tracking, and using the LangSmith playground to debug and improve workflows.

video 3 - The video covers different ways to add tracing in LangChain apps. It highlights the @traceable decorator for automatic run trees and introduces alternatives like environment variables, context managers, and wrapping OpenAI SDK calls to improve debugging and observability in LangSmith.
